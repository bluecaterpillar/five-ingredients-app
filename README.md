# This is the Five Ingredients App

To use this simple Rails app you need to:

* Install both Ruby and Rails in your system (if you don't have them already).
* Clone this git repo.
* Spin the rails server from the command line (from the repo folder).
* Navigate to your localhost: http://localhost:3000/
* From the home page, hit the "Seed your database!" button and wait 3 to 5 minutes for it to seed with more than 10k recipes in English.
* Start using the app, inserting up to 5 ingredients.
* Enjoy!
